Testing is an important part of any kind of development, be it software development or other kinds of development.
This section presents the different kinds of tests performed.

\section{Performance}

\todo{Results from performance tests and measurements}

\section{Energy Efficiency}

\todo{Results from energy efficiency tests and measurements}

\section{VHDL Test Benches}

Every component designed in VHDL has a corresponding test bench.
Informally, every \texttt{*.vhd} file has a \texttt{tb\_*.vhd} file.
Testing every component individually ensures a high quality processor implementation, as it is easy to find, isolate and correct bugs.

The test benches were simulated using ISim. See appendix \todo{add an appendix with tb test results, images} for the test results from the individual test benches. 

\section{Testing on the Spartan-6 FPGA}
