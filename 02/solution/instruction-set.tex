The solution processor implements a modified and expanded subset of the MIPS instruction set.
A quick reference of the MIPS instruction set can be found in Figure 3.4 of the compendium~\cite[p.112]{compendium}.
The instructions, as in regular MIPS, can be on one of three general formats: R, I and J~\cite[p.109-11]{compendium}.

The solution processor implements the instructions in table \vref{table:implemented-instructions}.
Although implementing a large instruction set was not a design goal in this assignment, as it was in assignment \#1\cite{assignment-1}, the processor still supports quite a few more instructions than the minimum requirements.
This is because of the addition of an assembler, which allows for pseudo-instructions.
The number of supported instructions in the instruction set all but doubles because of this.
