The processor presented as a solution for assignment \#2 in this report is a simple 32-bit MIPS-inspired pipelined processor described in VHDL.
It was programmed onto a Xilinx Spartan-6 LX16 FPGA.

\section{Assembler}

Bundled with the processor comes an assembler written in Python.
The modular and extensible assembler assembles the instruction set described in section \vref{section:instruction-set}.
It also supports labels and multi-line comments.
The assembler is hazard-aware, and will resolve use-after-load hazards by inserting nop instructions in the correct places to ensure correct execution on the processor.

Having an assembler also opens for the possibility of introducing pseudo-instructions, which are instructions that are converted into other instructions by the compiler.
As mentioned in section \vref{section:instruction-set}, a handful of pseudo-instructions are supported.
