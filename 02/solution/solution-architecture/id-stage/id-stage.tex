\todo{picture of decode stage}

The instruction decode stage receives an instruction from the instruction fetch stage and understands it.
Using this understanding, it orchestrates and coordinates the execution of the instruction.
This means that it is responsible for preparing the necessary data for the ALU, and setting the appropriate control signals for the rest of the processor for each instruction.
The register file of the processor resides in the instruction decode stage, and register data that are needed in computation in the execution stage are fetched and prepared in the instruction decode stage.
The control unit also resides in this stage.
