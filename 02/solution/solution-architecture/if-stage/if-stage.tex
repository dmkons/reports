\todo{image of fetch stage}

The instruction fetch stage is the first stage in the processor pipeline.
It is responsible for fetching the correct instruction from the instruction memory, and feeding it to the next stage in the pipeline.

\subsubsection{Program Counter}
In order to know where in the program the processor is currently executing, a program counter is needed.
The program counter is a simple register which holds the instruction address of the address currently being fetched and sent on to the next stage in the pipeline.
The instruction fetch stage updates the program counter each cycle, either by increasing it by one so as to fetch the next instruction, or by to a different number requested by a different part of the processor, in the case of a jump.
