This section describes the methodology used in creating the solution.

\section{Project Setup}

The Xilinx ISE project was set up with the design properties as in table \vref{table:design-properties}.

\begin{table}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
            \multicolumn{1}{ l }{\textbf{Property Name}} &
            \multicolumn{1}{ l }{\textbf{Value}} \\
            \multicolumn{2}{ l }{ } \\
            \hline
            Top-Level Source Type & HDL \\

\section{Things we did to increase performance (TODO: put this somewhere better in the report}

getting ideas from here: http://www.xilinx.com/itp/xilinx10/isehelp/ise\_c\_xst\_speed\_strategies.htm

synthesize  -> process properties: set opt goal to speed, opt level to normal, tried turning off resource sharing because Xilinx' HDL ADVISOR suggested that might be faster.

trying with disbling resource sharing again...


Lets try everything here: http://www.xilinx.com/itp/xilinx10/isehelp/ise\_c\_xst\_speed\_strategies.htm

Tried disabling dsp usage... is it faster? it takes longer to synthesize at least. yes! brings us from 42.793MHz to 55.117MHz

Tried going to opt high from opt normal, it was at 55.366. staying at normal then.


Disabled resource sharing, this sped us up to 56.277. sweet!

Trying to increase fanout 1000-fold.  no effect, reverting.
case implementation style has no effect, reverting.
trying with register balancing set to yes. no effect, reverting.
trying with optimize instantiated primitives. no effect, reverting.

trying with power optimization mode. no effect, so keeping it on!
