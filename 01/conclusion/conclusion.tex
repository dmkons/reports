A brief conclusion of the performed work.
Summarize the challenges and results.


VHDL was probably the hardest part. I mean, some sort of reference guide or brief explanation would be nice. Yes I know about and completed the tutorial which while it did serve as a nice introduction to Xilinx and modelsim does not really provide much in the way of VHDL voodoo skills.

An important lesson learned in this assignment is the value of setting realistic goals.
In this assignment, the additional goals set were too ambitious, which led to less focus on the parts of the solution that were required.
It would have been nice, for example, to have been able to test the solution processor on the FPGA, but there was simply not enough time left after all the extra instructions were implemented and properly tested.
