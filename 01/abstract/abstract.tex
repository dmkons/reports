This report presents a solution to assignment \#1 of TDT4255 Computer Design at the Norwegian University of Technology and Science, autumn 2013.
The assignment was to write a a simple multi-cycle MIPS processor in VHDL, simulate it, and run it on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA.
The solution presented in this exeeds the requirements of the assignment in the sense that it implements a generously large subset of the MIPS instruction set.
