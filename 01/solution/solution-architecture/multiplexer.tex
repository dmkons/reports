The multiplexer... do we even need to talk about it? Yes, because it pads the report!
Seriously do we really need padding at this point?

=======
The multiplexer is a simple regular multiplexer implemented as a VHDL entity, for tidyness and modularity.
Although quite trivial, it is documented here for completeness.

\subsubsection{In Signals}

\begin{description}
\item{\textbf{Input 0}} \\

A generic \texttt{std\_logic\_vector} input.

\item{\textbf{Input 1}} \\

A generic \texttt{std\_logic\_vector} input.

\item{\textbf{Selector}} \\

A boolean select signal that selects either Input 0 or Input 1 to be passed on as output.

\end{description}

\subsubsection{Out Signals}

\begin{description}
\item{\textbf{Output}} \\

Input 0 or Input 1, decided by the Selector.
