The ALU in the solution processor has been completely rewritten from scratch.
This was done so that the IEEE industry standard packages \texttt{numeric\_std} could be used.
Using \texttt{numeric\_std}, developers can safely express complex processes in a succinct and easy-to-read fashion, using the many built-in features.
Using industry standards for the solution processor was a goal for two reasons.
First, choosing the conventions and standards recommended by the industry is typically a good idea, as industry leaders have a lot of experience in their field.
Second, using well-documented and feature-rich standard libraries facilitate the implementation of many different CPU instructions, which was a prioritized goal for this exercise.

Although the suggested architecture in the compendium features an ALU control unit\cite{compendium}, it does not exist in the solution architecture.
Instead, the ALU control unit's responsibilities are covered for by the regular control unit.
This design choice was made for the flexibility it provides in implementing more instructions.
