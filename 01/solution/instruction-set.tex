The solution processor implements a modified subset of the MIPS instruction set.
A quick reference of the MIPS instruction set can be found in Figure 3.4 of the compendium \cite{compendium}.
The instructions, as in regular MIPS, can be on one of three general formats, R, I and J.

The solution processor implements the instructions in table \vref{table:implemented-instructions}.
The processor supports quite a few more instructions than the minimum requirements.
This is done in alignment with the design goals set for solution processor.
