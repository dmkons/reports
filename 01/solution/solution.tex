The processor presented as a solution for assignment 1 in this report is a 32-bit simple MIPS-inspired multi-cycle processor described in VHDL and programmed onto a Xilinx Spartan-6 LX25 FPGA.

\section{Requirements}

The requirements for the assignment is to design a simple multi-cycle MIPS architecture.
It must be based around the suggested MIPS-like architecture in Figure 4.1 of the course compendium\cite{compendium}.
Minimally, the following 10 insructions must be implemented:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\texttt{ADD}}
\item{\texttt{SUB}}
\item{\texttt{SLT}}
\item{\texttt{AND}}
\item{\texttt{OR}}
\item{\texttt{BEQ}}
\item{\texttt{LW}}
\item{\texttt{SW}}
\item{\texttt{LDI}\footnote{\texttt{LDI} is not actually a MIPS instruction, but it is assumed that it is interchangeable with \texttt{LUI}}}
\item{\texttt{J}}

\end{itemize}

Optionally, more instructions can be implemented.
The instruction set implemented by the solution processor is detailed in section [THE SECTION ABOUT THE ISA].

Once the processor is designed, it must also be verified in a simulation environment as well as in a hardware platform.

TODO: cite the compendium well enough when there is talk about requirements.

\section{Instruction Set Architecture}

The solution processor implements a modified subset of the MIPS instruction set.
A quick reference of the MIPS instruction set can be found in Figure 3.4 of the compendium \cite{compendium}.
The instructions, as in regular MIPS, can be on one of three general formats, R, I and J:

\begin{center}
    \begin{bytefield}[endianness=big,bitwidth=0.03125\linewidth]{32}
        \bitheader{0-31} \\
        \begin{rightwordgroup}{R}
            \bitbox{6}{Opcode} &
            \bitbox{5}{Rs} &
            \bitbox{5}{Rt} &
            \bitbox{5}{Rd} &
            \bitbox{5}{Shift}
            \bitbox{6}{Function}
        \end{rightwordgroup} \\
    \end{bytefield}
\end{center}

            \bitbox{6}{Opcode} &
            \bitbox{5}{Rs} &
            \bitbox{5}{Rt} &
            \bitbox{16}{Immediate}
        \end{rightwordgroup} \\
    \end{bytefield}
\end{center}

\bigskip

\begin{center}
    \begin{bytefield}[endianness=big,bitwidth=0.03125\linewidth]{32}
        \bitheader{0-31} \\
        \begin{rightwordgroup}{J}
            \bitbox{6}{Opcode} &
            \bitbox{26}{Address}
        \end{rightwordgroup} \\
    \end{bytefield}
\end{center}

(Yes, I just included these diagrams to show off with latex, really we can just refer to the reference sheet in the compendium).

The solution processor implements the instructions in table \ref{table:implemented-instructions}.
The processor supports quite a few more instructions than the minimum requirements.
This is done because (TODO: convincing argument).
