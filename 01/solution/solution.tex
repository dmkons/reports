The processor presented as a solution for assignment 1 in this report is a simple 32-bit MIPS-inspired multi-cycle processor described in VHDL.
It was attempted programmed onto a Xilinx Spartan-6 LX25 FPGA.

\section{Solution Architecture}

\input{solution/solution-architecture.tex}

\subsection{ALU}

The ALU in the solution processor has been completely rewritten from scratch.
This was done so that the IEEE industry standard packages \texttt{numeric\_std} could be used.
Using \texttt{numeric\_std}, developers can safely express complex processes using the many built-in features.
Using industry standards for the solution processor was a goal for two reasons.
First, choosing the conventions and standards recommended by the industry is typically a good idea, as industry leaders have a lot of experience in their field.
Second, using well-documented and feature-rich standard libraries facilitate the implementation of many different CPU instructions, which was a prioritized goal for this exercise.

Although the suggested architecture in the compendium features an ALU control unit\cite{compendium}, it does not exist in the solution architecture.
Instead, the ALU control unit's responsibilities are covered for by the regular control unit.
This design choice was made for the flexibility it provides in implementing more instructions.

\subsection{Branch Controller}

The branch controller the logic unit that decides whether or not the program should branch.
It is separate from the main control unit, as it works independently from the control unit state machine, and does not need to follow the clock.
The branch controller reads the opcode field from the current instruction, looking for branch instructions.
If it finds a branch instruction, it will apply the logic that is required for that instruction.

Having branch logic contained in a separate branch controller gives the opportunity to implement many different branch instructions in a modular manner.

To handle the simplest operations that compare two registers to each other, the branch controller can simply look at the flags from the ALU to decide if the branch MUX should be enabled.
Instructions that compare a register to zero require a bit more work from the branch controller.
The branch controller can send out a zero value that overrides the ALU's source for the $ y $ operand, and is compared to the $ x $ operand from the register specified in the instruction.

To allow for other compare operations than $x \geq 0$ and $x < 0$, the zero value will not always be zero. 
Because the solution processor only handles integers, the comparison $ x \geq 1 $ is equivalent with $ x > 0 $.
This trick means that support for branch operations other than zero and negative are not needed, which nicely reduces complexity in the design without sacrificing performance.
Therefore the zero value from the branch controller vary from -1 to 1.

The control unit drives the branch controller by instructing the ALU to do a subtraction on its inputs, $ x - y $, and ignore the result.
This sets the zero flag of the ALU if the x = y, and the negative flag of the ALU if the x < y.
It is these flags that is used by the branch controller to detemin if it should branch.

\subsection{Control Unit}

The control unit is a finite state machine that controls the processor.
Its job is to maintain the control state across cycles, and distribute the correct control signals to the other components in the processor at the right time.
The finite state machine has three states: fetch, execute and stall.
It advances to the next state on every cycle, with transitions as illustrated in figure \ref{figure:control-unit-state-machine}.

        \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2.8cm, semithick]
            \tikzstyle{every state}=[fill=none,draw=black,text=black]
            \node[initial,state] (fetch)                    {$fetch$};
            \node[state]         (execute) [right of=fetch] {$execute$};
            \node[state]         (stall) [right of=execute] {$stall$};
            \path (fetch) edge node {} (execute)
                (execute) edge [bend left] node {non-mem} (fetch)
                (execute) edge node {mem} (stall)
                (stall) edge [bend right] node {} (fetch);
        \end{tikzpicture}
            \caption{

TODO: explain the signals that come out of the control unit

Here is a list for now populated by the signal names and Odd's educated guesses and brief explanations of the obvious.

\subsubsection{ALU Source}
The control signal for the ALU Source MUX. If 1 then the MUX selects the output from Sign Extend, if 0 it selects the signal from Read Data 2 in the Registers block.

\subsubsection{Register Write}
Does this turn on if we are writing to a register?

\subsubsection{Register Destination}
If 1 then the the Register Destination MUX outputs bits 15-11 of the instruction. If 0 then it outputs bits 20-16 of the instruction. Either way it feeds this to the Write Register port on the Registers block.

\subsubsection{Memory to Register}
Is this like, fetch? Are we putting memory in the registers?

\subsubsection{Memory Write}
I guess this is set if the instruction writes to memory?

\subsubsection{Jump}
The Jump signal indicates whether or not the current instruction is a jump instruction. If it is, the Jump signal is set to $1$ which causes the Jump MUX to output the Jump Address signal from Concat.

\subsection{Program Counter Cycle}

The program counter cycle is the loop the program counter forms together with the branch and jump circuitry.
The program counter is a D-latch register (TODO: is it?) that holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
When no branching or jumping is involved (the ``sunny day scenario''), the program counter cycle increments the program counter by one every cycle the control unit tells it to.
This means that the control unit has the opportunity to advance the running program.
The control unit advances the program counter when it is in the execute state, so that a new program counter value is ready for when the control unit enters the fetch state.

When the control unit gives the signal, the program counter may perform a branch or a jump by manipulating the program counter cycle to change the value sent back to the program counter.

TODO: diagram of the program counter cycle.

\subsection{Multiplexer}

The multiplexer... do we even need to talk about it?

\section{Instruction Set}

The solution processor implements a modified subset of the MIPS instruction set.
A quick reference of the MIPS instruction set can be found in Figure 3.4 of the compendium \cite{compendium}.
The instructions, as in regular MIPS, can be on one of three general formats, R, I and J.

The solution processor implements the instructions in table \ref{table:implemented-instructions}.
The processor supports quite a few more instructions than the minimum requirements.
This is done because (TODO: convincing argument).
