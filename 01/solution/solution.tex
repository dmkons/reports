\section{Solution Architecture}

TODO: an image, box and arrows-style

\subsection{ALU}

Something about the alu.

\subsection{Branch Controller}

TODO: rune will write about this.

\subsection{Control Unit}

The control unit is a finite state machine that controls the processor.
Its job is to maintain control state across cycles, and distribute the correct control signals to the other components in the processor at the right time.
The finite state machine has three states: fetch, execute and stall.
It advances to the next state on every cycle, with transitions as illustrated in figure \ref{figure:control-unit-state-machine}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[->,>=stealth',shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=2.8cm, semithick]
            \tikzstyle{every state}=[fill=none,draw=black,text=black]
            \node[initial,state] (fetch)                    {$fetch$};
            \node[state]         (execute) [right of=fetch] {$execute$};
            \node[state]         (stall) [right of=execute] {$stall$};
            \path (fetch) edge node {} (execute)
                (execute) edge [bend left] node {non-mem} (fetch)
                (execute) edge node {mem} (stall)
                (stall) edge [bend right] node {} (fetch);
        \end{tikzpicture}
            \caption{

                \texttt{mem} transitions are taken when the currently executed instruction accesses memory.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

TODO: explain the signals that come out of the control unit

\subsection{Program Counter Cycle}

The program counter cycle is the loop the program counter forms together with the branch and jump circuitry.
The program counter is a D-latch register (TODO: is it?) that holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.
When no branching or jumping is involved (the "sunny day scenario"), the program counter cycle increments the program counter by one every cycle the control unit tells it to.
This means that the control unit has the opportunity to advance the running program.
The control unit advances the program counter when it is in the execute state, so that a new program counter value is ready for when the control unit enters the fetch state.

When the control unit gives the signal, the program counter may perform a branch or a jump by manipulating the program counter cycle to change the value sent back to the program counter.

TODO: diagram of the program counter cycle.

\subsection{Multiplexer}

The multiplexer... do we even need to talk about it?

\section{Instruction Set}

The solution processor implements a modified subset of the MIPS instruction set.
A quick reference of the MIPS instruction set can be found in Figure 3.4 of the compendium \cite{compendium}.
The instructions, as in regular MIPS, can be on one of three general formats, R, I and J.

The solution processor implements the instructions in table \ref{table:implemented-instructions}.
The processor supports quite a few more instructions than the minimum requirements.
This is done because (TODO: convincing argument).
