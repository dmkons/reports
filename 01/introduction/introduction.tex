Introduces the task of the assignment and the challenges it
brings.
Also, it gives a brief introduction to how the task was approached and in which way the solution was reached.

\section{Requirements}

The requirements for the assignment is to design a simple multi-cycle MIPS architecture.
It must be based around the suggested MIPS-like architecture in Figure 4.1 of the course compendium\cite{compendium}.
Minimally, the 10 insructions in table \ref{table:required-instructions} must be implemented.

\begin{table}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{r|l}
            \texttt{ADD} & Add \\
            \texttt{AND} & And \\
            \texttt{BEQ} & Branch if equal \\
            \texttt{J} & Jump \\
            \texttt{LDI}\footnote{\texttt{LDI} is not actually a MIPS instruction, but it is assumed that it is interchangeable with \texttt{LUI}} & Load immediate \\
            \texttt{LW} & Load word \\
            \texttt{OR} & Or \\
            \texttt{SLT} & Set less than \\
            \texttt{SUB} & Subtract \\
            \texttt{SW} & Store word \\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}

        \caption{Required instructions}
        \label{table:required-instructions}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

Optionally, more instructions can be implemented.
The instruction set implemented by the solution processor is detailed in section [THE SECTION ABOUT THE ISA].

Once the processor is designed, it must also be verified in a simulation environment as well as in a hardware platform.

TODO: cite the compendium well enough when there is talk about requirements.
